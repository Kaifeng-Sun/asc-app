        Health and Fitness are the key areas of AISA's focus, which is about
        achieving a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being in
        a person. The steps one can take to improve this feeling of well-being
        include not only keeping physically and mentally active but also
        remaining socially connected with others. AISA plays its part by
        conducting a range of activities for its members, including regular
        sessions in health education; exercises, sports and indoor games; social
        get-togethers interspersed with entertainment activities; outdoor
        picnics and trips; and culturally vibrant functions and events. The
        Association invests in these activities and events in the firm belief
        that by embracing an active lifestyle in socially stimulating settings
        our seniors would continue to enhance their physical and mental health
        and the feeling of overall well-being.
