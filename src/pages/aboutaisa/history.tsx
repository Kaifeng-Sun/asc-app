        AISA was registered as an incorporated association on 22 November 2019,
        although its formation has evolved from a small number of informal
        groups of Indian Seniors undertaking regular activities at Wadham House
        Community Activity Centre, Mount Waverley, since 2016. These activities
        included Table Tennis, Chair Exercise Classes, Bridge, and Social
        Events, all conducted on self-funded basis. As interest in these
        activities grew, the need to have larger, more suitable, premises became
        obvious, which led to the establishment of AISA as a vehicle to seek
        external funding and expand the range of activities offered. Since its
        incorporation AISA has been quite successful in securing adequate
        funding from various sources and, with volunteersâ€™ support, expanding
        the range and frequency of its activities. Its membership has also
        continued to grow strongly and steadily during this period, despite the
        fact that for almost two years of its initial existence as an
        incorporated body it had to function under a COVID-ravaged environment
        featuring repeated lockdowns and varying degrees of restrictions.
