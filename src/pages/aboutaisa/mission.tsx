        AISA’s mission is to organise a variety of activities and events that
        benefit members' physical and mental health and keep them socially
        engaged within the community and suitably informed about the topics of
        relevance to them. AISA’S modus operandi is Mutual Help, guided by
        skilled volunteers from within the community, giving their time for the
        benefit of members with sincerity, integrity, and commitment.
