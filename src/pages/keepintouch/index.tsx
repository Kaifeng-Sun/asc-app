        As is true for anything in life, you get out of something as much as you
        put into it! AISA’s activities are there for its members to enjoy and
        are run entirely by volunteers who devote a lot of their time in making
        things happen. To keep these activities going, members’ enthusiastic and
        regular participation is essential, as are their contributions as
        volunteers wherever possible.
      </div>
      <div>
        Equally important is members’ feedback and suggestions for new ideas.
        Please feel free to fill out the following form with your input,
        indicating also whether you would be able to volunteer in running any of
        AISA’s activities.
