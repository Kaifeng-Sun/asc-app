      <div>
        AISA has also introduced several special-purpose initiatives to address
        the needs of its members. Activities relating to these initiatives are
        held periodically as per the requirements of specific interest groups.
      </div>
      <div>
        • Legal Clinic (pro bono), held monthly with prior bookings at Wadham
        House Community Activity Centre, to enable members to obtain preliminary
        legal opinion on any legal matters of concern to them in one-on-one
        meetings from an in-house practising lawyer.
      </div>
      <div>
        • Health Seminars, held periodically in the form of a presentation,
        followed by a Q&A session, to exchange useful information on topics of
        health specifically relevant for the seniors.
      </div>
      <div>
        • AISA Women’s Forum, under trial at present and in the process of more
        fully defined, is aimed at activities of specific interest to, and run
        by, AISA’s women members. Currently, as part of this initiative, 'women
        only' fitness sessions are being held every week at Brandon Park
        Community Centre.
