        Baithak is an Indian word meaning a get-together or meeting of people,
        usually in indoor settings, for chit-chat, discussion or a friendly
        activity. AISA holds baithaks every Monday at Brandon Park Community
        Centre, Glen Waverley, to facilitate social interaction and improved
        connectedness amongst its members. Every baithak session is held
        interspersed with a pre-defined theme activity, which varies from week
        to week. The sessions usually starts with an hour of Chair Exercises,
        followed by the theme activity, and then winding down with lunch and
        chit-chat. The theme activities typically include Sangeet,
        Documentaries, Bingo, or Talks and Discussion. On every 5th Monday, if
        there is one in a month, a Community Lunch is arranged, together with
        either a presentation on an informative topic or a free-flowing program.
