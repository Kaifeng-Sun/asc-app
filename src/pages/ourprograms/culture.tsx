      <div>
        Occasionally, depending upon member demand, AISA organises 'friendship
        dinners' where members can enjoy one another's company in smaller, cosy,
        settings.

        AISA also conducts two major cultural functions in a year, namely Holi
        and Diwali, normally held around March and October timeframes
        respectively. They usually attract larger attendances, and typically
        involve a variety cultural-cum-entertainment program followed by a
        three-course meal.
      </div>
      <div>Picnics & Trips</div>
      <div>
        AISA's outdoor programs, such as picnics and day-trips, are important
        activities that get members out of their usual routines to enjoy nature
        or stimulating outdoor activities in the company of their
        community-friends. Held between two and four times in a year, these
        programs are well patronised by the members.

        Members can participate in any of these activities by contacting the
        relevant co-ordinators. Further details regarding the activities and the
        co-ordinators are included in the attached Updated 'AISA Activities
        Schedule'. Attach AISA Activities Schedule
